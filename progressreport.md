The GitHub README.md file is an introduction to this repository.

This file is for the purpose of additional documentation which includes some
initial analysis and the progress of the steps taken to build this project.

This particular project is primarialy for the purpose of learning to progress
from beginner to modest understanding of Django website development.

This documentation is for my personal reference to record the actual progress
of this project.  It may also be helpful to other beginners to see my learning
struggles and associated issues.  Most of us probably make similar mistakes and
meet similar road blocks to our understanding of concepts.  This does get
complex and progress will include some attempts that have to be changed or
completely removed.
