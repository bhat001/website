# website
Django Project "website" is my first website using django (beginner level).

Website Objective

Create an application "documents".  Upload odt and pdf documents for personal documentation.
To display those documents in a browser will require a tool such as viewerjs.  At this time
I do not know if the viewerjs will be compatible with django urls?

Development Prossess

The development process is a start from scratch.  Initially an empty django project has been
created with a single application named "documents". 

At the beginning I have been struggling to learn GitHub and Git. This is the second attempt
to create this repository.  Because of that there are a few modifications to the original
install of the django project and application.  

This readme file is not the place to document the development process so I have created a file
named "progressreport.md" to keep track of work in progress.  For other beginners this may
be helpful. 

Why Follow this Repository

I hope other beginners may find this repository interesting.  The website will be tested on 
localhost and everything will work before being committed to the master branch.  This website will use
class based templates, coding will attempt to follow best practices.  In addition, my uploaded
documents for testing are also related documentation.

This repository is not intended for production use.  It is for learning and practice. To anyone that 
wishes to clone this repository I would suggest you consider security issues. I have not focused on
security issues for a web hosted website.

Documentation Specifics

I intend to include test documents for my own documentation of this process.  They may
be a bit wordy and repetitive.  Documentation will be specific to Ubuntu linux and django and git.

Python for the venv is version 3.  In Ubuntu python is version 2.7.  Assume python = python3.

Not Exactly a Tutorial

This is not exactly a tutorial but if things go as planned the tasks leading to each commit should
follow logical website development process.  It is a tutorial for me and maybe it will be a bit
of a tutorial for other beginners.
